<p> A little background information about me is that I grew up living with my mom Irene, my dad Jim, and brother Ian. We also consider my dog Tofie, a golden retriever, part of the family too. My mom works as a librarian at a high school and my dad works as an engineer. Something most people don't know about me is that I'm Slovenian. My moms first language was Slovene so I have a good understanding of it. I originally wanted to go to a city school and applied to almost all schools in Boston or around Massachusetts. About 2 months before you had to make a decision to pick a school, I decided to apply to UMAINE because I loved the typical college campus and the winter because it's my favorite season, but we'll see if it still is after the first winter here!
