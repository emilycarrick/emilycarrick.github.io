<h1>Hobbies</h1>


<p>Some of my main hobbies include reading, skiing, hiking, running, playing piano, and traveling. So far I have read about 3 books since this summer all in the genre mystery, my favorite. Every year in January my friends and I from back home will go to Vermont to ski at Okemo for the weekend. Okemo is one of my favorite places to ski! Last year I also skied in Quebec, Canada which I also really enjoyed. Since skiing isn't year round, one of my favorite spring and summer sports is running. I run with my dog and my dad. I also can play 3 full classical songs on piano. I took lessons when I was younger but lost most of my memory of how to play but it’s still one of my favorite things to do when I’m bored or around my piano. My biggest hobby is traveling. Over this past year I traveled to Italy, Germany, England, France, Switzerland, Austria, Canada, and hiked in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. My favorite place to visit is Germany or the Swiss Alps because the view is really astonishing.
