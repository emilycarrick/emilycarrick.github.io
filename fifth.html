<h1>Jobs</h1>

<p>Starting the summer going into my junior year of high school I started my first job at Dairy Queen! I hated it at first because it was hard to make the cones from the soft serve ice cream machine. After the first month went by I started to love it because all my co-workers and I got along and would hangout outside work. I also think it helped me prepare for bigger jobs because of the time management it taught me. The second job I ever had was during my last semester of high school. I got an internship in Royal Tunbridge Wells, England and worked in a charity shop for cancer. I stayed and worked in the shop for about a month and learned some of the biggest skills I needed to take with me for future career.
